        OG entered The International 2016 as one of the favorites after earning a direct invite, but ended up finishing 9-12th out of 16 teams. In August 2016, MoonMeander, Miracle-, and Cr1t- left the team, with Gustav "s4" Magnusson, Anathan "ana" Pham, and Jesse "JerAx" Vainikka replacing them. Despite the new roster, OG won the Boston Major in December 2016, giving them their third Dota 2 Major championship.
